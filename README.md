# AI-Driven Site Feasibility

## Purpose

The AI-Driven Site Feasibility Assessment Tool predicts the suitability of clinical trial sites by analyzing:

* Historical performance (e.g., enrollment rates, protocol deviations)
* Trial requirements (e.g., therapeutic area, patient demographics)
* External factors (e.g., disease prevalence, geographic data)

It assigns feasibility scores to clinical sites and generates human-readable summaries to support data-driven decision-making.

## Market Study: Why This Product Now?

The clinical trial landscape is undergoing a transformation:

1. Rising costs and delays: \~40% of delays stem from poor site selection (Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development).
2. Decentralization trends are pushing sponsors to explore new geographies ‚Äî making predictive selection critical.
3. Too much data, not enough intelligence: Site-related data exists in silos (CTMS, past trial data, regulatory feedback, survey tools).

## Competitive Landscape

**Existing Players**

* CROs (e.g., IQVIA, Parexel) use proprietary tools for site selection.
* Startups like Deep 6 AI leverage AI for patient-site matching.

**Gap Identified**

* Most existing tools focus on patient recruitment or monitoring.
* Very few offer predictive, end-to-end site feasibility assessment with generative AI summaries to support decision-making.

---

## Relevance to Our Organization

This solution complements existing internal initiatives such as:

* Risk-Based Prioritization ‚Äì for task prioritization during study conduct
* AI-Powered Site Performance ‚Äì for ongoing site monitoring

It fills a gap by supporting proactive site selection at the study start-up phase.

## Customer Analysis

**Primary Customers**

* Clinical Operations Teams ‚Äì responsible for study start-up; need faster, data-driven site selection
* Sponsors (Pharma/Biotech) ‚Äì want cost-effective trials with high success rates
* CROs (Contract Research Organizations) ‚Äì need scalable tools to manage multiple trials

**Customer Pain Points**

* Manual site selection is time-consuming and error-prone
* Lack of predictive insights leads to selection of underperforming sites
* Difficulties in integrating diverse data sources (e.g., historical, demographic, infrastructure)

**Customer Goals**

* Reduce study start-up time by 20‚Äì30%
* Increase enrollment success rates by selecting high-performing sites
* Ensure compliance with regulatory standards from the start
