# AI-Driven Site Feasibility

## Purpose

The AI-Driven Site Feasibility Assessment Tool predicts the suitability of clinical trial sites by analyzing:

* Historical performance (e.g., enrollment rates, protocol deviations)
* Trial requirements (e.g., therapeutic area, patient demographics)
* External factors (e.g., disease prevalence, geographic data)

It assigns feasibility scores to clinical sites and generates human-readable summaries to support data-driven decision-making.

## Market Study: Why This Product Now?

The clinical trial landscape is undergoing a transformation:

1. Rising costs and delays: \~40% of delays stem from poor site selection (Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development).
2. Decentralization trends are pushing sponsors to explore new geographies — making predictive selection critical.
3. Too much data, not enough intelligence: Site-related data exists in silos (CTMS, past trial data, regulatory feedback, survey tools).

## Competitive Landscape

**Existing Players**

* CROs (e.g., IQVIA, Parexel) use proprietary tools for site selection.
* Startups like Deep 6 AI leverage AI for patient-site matching.

**Gap Identified**

* Most existing tools focus on patient recruitment or monitoring.
* Very few offer predictive, end-to-end site feasibility assessment with generative AI summaries to support decision-making.

---

## Relevance to Our Organization

This solution complements existing internal initiatives such as:

* Risk-Based Prioritization – for task prioritization during study conduct
* AI-Powered Site Performance – for ongoing site monitoring

It fills a gap by supporting proactive site selection at the study start-up phase.

## Customer Analysis

**Primary Customers**

* Clinical Operations Teams – responsible for study start-up; need faster, data-driven site selection
* Sponsors (Pharma/Biotech) – want cost-effective trials with high success rates
* CROs (Contract Research Organizations) – need scalable tools to manage multiple trials

**Customer Pain Points**

* Manual site selection is time-consuming and error-prone
* Lack of predictive insights leads to selection of underperforming sites
* Difficulties in integrating diverse data sources (e.g., historical, demographic, infrastructure)

**Customer Goals**

* Reduce study start-up time by 20–30%
* Increase enrollment success rates by selecting high-performing sites
* Ensure compliance with regulatory standards from the start
